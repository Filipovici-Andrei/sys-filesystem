= Description
   A Ruby interface for getting file system information.

= Prerequisites
=== MS Windows 
* windows-pr, 0.9.8 or later.

= Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) OR rake install_gem (gem)

= Synopsis
   require 'sys/filesystem'
   include Sys
   
   # Display information about a particular filesystem.
   p Filesystem.stat('/')

   # Sample output

   #<Sys::Filesystem::Stat:0x517440
      @base_type = "ufs",
      @flags = 4,
      @files_available = 3817457,
      @block_size = 8192,
      @blocks_available = 19957633,
      @blocks = 34349612,
      @name_max = 255,
      @path = "/",
      @filesystem_id = 35651592,
      @files = 4135040,
      @fragment_size = 1024,
      @files_free = 3817457,
      @blocks_free = 20301129
   >
   
   # Describe all mount points on the system
   Filesystem.mounts{ |mount| p mount }
   
   # Find the mount point of any particular file
   puts Filesystem.mount_point('/home/djberge/some_file.txt') => '/home'

= Notes
=== MS Windows
   This is a pure Ruby implementation using the windows-pr library, which in
   turn wraps native Windows functions.
=== UNIX
   This is a C extension that wraps statvfs, etc.

= Sample code
   Run 'rake example' if you want to see a basic sample run. The actual code
   is 'example_stat.rb' in the 'examples' directory. Modify it as you see fit.

= Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of.  Please report bugs on the project page at
   http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/sysutils.

= Future Plans
   Suggestions welcome.
